Your word is: (audio of word)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

There's a piece of paper on the podium, where you can practice writing down the word: <input type="text" name="fname" id="fname" onblur="myFunction()">

<script>
function myFunction() {
    var x = document.getElementById("fname");
	window.confirm("You can't cheat!");
}
</script>

(link-goto: "I'm ready to spell the word", "Enter Word 1")
// This isn't working very well at all...have it just time out if they don't enter their word quickly enough?
