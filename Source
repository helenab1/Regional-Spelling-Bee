&quot;Everyone here can be proud of their munchkin tonight, because it takes discipline and perserverence to study the art of spelling in the age of distractions.

I mean, he still got into Stanford, (link-reveal: &quot;but he&#39;s an exceptional child.&quot;) [

&quot;By the way, I&#39;m Judge April Rose Holly, and I&#39;ll be your host for this event. Before I was a judge here I was a high school English teacher, and before that I was a legal secretary. Back in those days we had to use Windows 98, and Word didn&#39;t automatically put that red squiggly line under all your misspelled words, (link-reveal: &quot;you had to run a manual spell check at the end.&quot;) [

&quot;And before I was a secretary I was a beauty queen, only one stroke of bad luck short of Miss California 1996.&quot; Judge Holly smiles and waves to the crowd. &quot;But my love of competition never died. And hosting these bees is my passion.

Katie can say that she relies on her phone for all her studying while you hang out with her, and you can steal her phone for the bad point.

Winning with three bad points: You got the trophy, and does it matter who you had to step on to get here? You won a regional spelling bee in Bakersfield, the world is yours! Congratulations on being an accomplished little sociopath.

Winning with one or two: You dabbled in bullying and sabotage, but in the end you buckled down and won the trophy (mostly) based on your own merits. Congratulations!

Winning with 0 bad points: You studied hard and you did it all on your own. You&#39;re a literal angel, and your parents are so proud. You&#39;ve got national spelling bee written all over you, kid. Congratulations!
