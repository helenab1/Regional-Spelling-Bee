&quot;By the way, I&#39;m Judge April Rose Holly, and I&#39;ll be your host for this event. Before I was a judge here I was a high school English teacher, and before that I was a legal secretary. Back in those days we had to use Windows 98, and Word didn&#39;t automatically put that red squiggly line under all your misspelled words, (link-reveal: &quot;you had to run a manual spell check at the end.&quot;) [
